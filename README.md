## How to install 
You can get it (once you downloaded the code) running by going to about:debugging in firefox and clicking the "this firefox" link and clicking "Load Temporany Add-on" and finding the main manifest.json file from my code. This is only a temporary solution since it resets every time you restart firefox and I have already submitted it to the add-on store, I just need to wait for it to be approved but until then you can use the regular extension
